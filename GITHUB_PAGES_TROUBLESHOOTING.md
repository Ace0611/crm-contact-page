# GitHub Pages Deployment Troubleshooting

## 🚨 Current Issue: Git Error (Exit Code 128)

The deployment is failing with "The process '/usr/bin/git' failed with exit code 128". This is a common issue with GitHub Pages deployment.

## 🔧 Solutions (Try in Order)

### Solution 1: Enable GitHub Pages First

**CRITICAL**: You MUST enable GitHub Pages before the workflow can work:

1. Go to: `https://github.com/ace0611/crm-contact-page/settings/pages`
2. Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Click **"Save"**
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub to set up the Pages environment

### Solution 2: Use the Simple Workflow

I've created multiple workflow options. Try the simplest one:

1. **Disable the current workflow**: Go to Actions tab → Click on "Deploy to GitHub Pages" → Click "Disable workflow"
2. **Enable the simple workflow**: Go to Actions tab → Click on "Deploy to GitHub Pages (Simple)" → Click "Enable workflow"
3. **Push a change** to trigger the new workflow

### Solution 3: Manual Deployment

If workflows keep failing, deploy manually:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for GitHub Pages
npm run build:github

# Deploy manually
npm run deploy:github
```

### Solution 4: Check Repository Settings

Make sure:

- [ ] Repository is **public** (GitHub Pages requires public repos for free accounts)
- [ ] GitHub Pages is **enabled** in Settings → Pages
- [ ] Source is set to **"GitHub Actions"**
- [ ] You have **write permissions** to the repository

## 📋 Workflow Options Available

I've created 3 different workflows for you to try:

1. **`deploy.yml`** - Modern GitHub Pages actions (current)
2. **`deploy-simple.yml`** - Simple peaceiris action with Git config
3. **`deploy-alternative.yml`** - Direct gh-pages command

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Fix

1. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Source: "GitHub Actions"
   - Save

2. **Try Simple Workflow**:
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Disable current workflow
   - Enable "Deploy to GitHub Pages (Simple)"
   - Push a change

3. **If Still Failing**:
   - Check if repository is public
   - Verify you have write permissions
   - Try manual deployment

## 🔍 Debug Information

**Repository**: `ace0611/crm-contact-page`
**Expected URL**: `https://ace0611.github.io/crm-contact-page/`
**Base Path**: `/crm-contact-page/` (set in vite.config.ts)

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

The most common causes are:

1. **GitHub Pages not enabled** (90% of cases)
2. **Repository not public** (5% of cases)
3. **Wrong permissions** (3% of cases)
4. **Workflow configuration** (2% of cases)

Try enabling GitHub Pages first - that fixes most issues!
